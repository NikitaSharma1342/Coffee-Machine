# Coffee-Machine
Its a digital version of coffee-machine which is python scripted
# Description

In this digital coffee machine we have generated three hot flavors which are espresso, latte and cappuccino. There are recipes for these three types of drinks.
Each of them requires a different quantity of water, a different quantity of coffee and a different quantity of milk. And also, they are differently priced. All this data is included in a dictionary.

Moreover, the coffee machine has some resources that it has to manage. So it starts out with 300ml of water in the tank, 200ml of milk and 100 grams of coffee. The second feature of our coffee machine is that it's coin operated. Here we have used American coins and they have four types of coins:
* Penny 
* Nickel 
* Dime 
* Quarter

Our coffee machine will be able to print a report, when the user types report in input. It will tell us what resources are left.
Machine will also check if the resources are sufficient, when the user orders a drink. 

The coffee machine is able to look through all the resources that the machine has, checks it against the recipe of the drink that we're trying to make, and tells the user if there is insufficient water or if there's insufficient milk, and as long as one of the resources is insufficient, if it can't make the drink and it will give the feedback to the user.

In addition to being able to process the four types of coins by noticing what each of these coins are worth  like the penny is worth a cent, the nickel worth 5 cents and the dime 10 cents, and the quarter is a quarter of a dollar, it can also calculate the actual monetary value based on the number of points and check if transaction is successful. If user hasn't inserted enough coins, then we're just going to refund them and tell them, sorry  that's not enough money, and not give them their drink.

But if the transaction is successful, then we're going to make the coffee. And in the process of making the coffee, we also deduct the resources.

The user can simply turn off the coffee machine by typing 'off'.
